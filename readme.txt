Bring the power of Facebook Photo comments to your website.

The Gallery Share plugin makes photo sharing and commenting as easy as in Facebook. It has a super-familiar-Facebook-style appearance that will make your visitors think they are on Facebook. They will be able to share and comment on each individual image on your blog. The Plugin creates unique URLs for all images, making them super-easy to be shared. Now you can social share each image independently, in addition to sharing the entire article. A must-have for photographers and photo-Like-contest creators.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin work with NextGEN galleries? =

Yes, it does - there is an extra step you need to take for that. Go to the NextGEN Options page in WordPress (Gallery->Options), go to the 'Effects' tab, select 'None' 

and save.

= Sometimes the image that is displayed on Facebook is different than the one I shared. Why is that? =

You may have another plugin on your blog that generates Facebook tags and interferes with Gallery Share. Try disabling temporarily the other plugin and see if the 

behavior has been corrected.
Also, this may happen with images from NextGEN galleries. In both cases, the shared link will be the correct one.

= Why do I see two lightboxes when I click on an image? =

This means that you have another plugin that generates lightboxes for images, or that you have NextGEN and it wasn't configured according to the instructions found in 

Gallery Share's settings page.
